Had some truble when i tried to install sdk via linux subsystem for windows, so i installed it by git bash instead.
Other than that i had no problems with the installation.
I chose to use docker instead of podman.

I ran through all the parts SDE and checked that i didn't get any error messages.

I had some problems with the docker image, but that was because i was unfamiliar with docker so i read up on it and got it to work in the end. 

i think i got everything working fine and here is the link to my docker image:
